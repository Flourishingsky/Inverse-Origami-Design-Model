This software is developed based on an inverse origami design model, aiming to assist users with or without experience in origami design to produce the origami with the desired cross-sectional shapes. The generated origami is constructed based on General Miura origami pattern and keeps axial compression. The software is built based on Matlab (2018a) GUI platform.
