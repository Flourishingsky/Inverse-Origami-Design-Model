# Inverse-Origami-Design-Model
This software is developed based on an inverse origami design model, aiming to assist users with or without experience in origami design to produce the origami with the desired cross-sectional shapes. The generated origami is constructed based on General Miura origami pattern and keeps axial compression. The software is built based on Matlab (2018a) GUI platform.
